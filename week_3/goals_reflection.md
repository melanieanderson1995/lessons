## Weekly Reflection ##
### Question 1: ###
Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?
* I've started setting more manageable goals, but I got sidetracked with making the afternoon challenge more complex rather than focusing on the practicals
### Question 2: ###
What would you change/improve moving forward?
* Technical: Go over whatever steps I complete separately from the walkthrough so I can guarantee I'm not just copying them but that I'm really understanding them. Study harder in the morning sessions.
* Personal: Remember to rest! By Sunday I was so burnt out and ill feeling that I wasn't able to work, I need to make sure that I'm sleeping appropriate amounts and eating more regularly
