## Weekly Reflection ##
### Question 1: ###
Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?
* I met most of my goals, but I also think I overloaded myself with work to do and it overwhelmed me. I need to set more manageable goals that are easier and require less time so it's not a frenzy to complete all of them (thereby losing actual comprehension).
### Question 2: ###
What would you change/improve moving forward?
* Technical: Try to break away from the walk through more, focus more on driving rather than just navigating
* Personal: Set easier smaller goals so they're not so overwhelming to achieve. Kept mood good through most of the week, need to spend more time working on the weekends (but still take at least 1 whole day off to recharge).
