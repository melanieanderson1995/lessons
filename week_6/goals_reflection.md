### Question 1: ###
Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?
* I did, although I set really easy goals for myself as I wasn't feeling very well. However, I feel that I worked well in the group, and we got a lot accomplished.
### Question 2: ###
What would you change/improve moving forward?
* Technical: Go over building interfaces and app.rb material
* Personal: Be more active in the group
