## Weekly Reflection ##
### Question 1: ###
Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?
* I took a large portion of this week for rest as I felt I was getting burnt out. I managed to meet most of my goals to differing degrees, as evidenced in this folder and my notes
### Question 2: ###
What would you change/improve moving forward?
* Technical: Get back into regular goals and do more research on my own in the morning
* Personal: Good job on getting rest this week, now I have to get back into doing regular work and focus on working more in the morning
